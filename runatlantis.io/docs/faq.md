# FAQ

**Q: Does Atlantis affect Terraform [remote state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/remote)?**

A: No. Atlantis does not interfere with Terraform remote state in any way. Under the hood, Atlantis is simply executing `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.

**Q: How does Atlantis locking interact with Terraform [locking](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/locking)?**

A: Atlantis provides locking of pull requests that prevents concurrent modification of the same infrastructure (Terraform project) whereas Terraform locking only prevents two concurrent `terraform apply`'s from happening.

Terraform locking can be used alongside Atlantis locking since Atlantis is simply executing terraform commands.

**Q: How to run Atlantis in high availability mode? Does it need to be?**

A: Atlantis server can easily be run under the supervision of an init system like `upstart` or `systemd` to make sure `atlantis server` is always running.

Atlantis stores locks and pull request status in the Kubernetes API (Leases and `PullStatus` resources), so any number of replicas can run at once. Each pull request is handled by one replica; webhooks that reach another replica are forwarded to it. See [Kubernetes-native Atlantis](https://github.com/App-First-Step/katlantis/blob/master/docs/kubernetes-native.md) and the Helm chart.

Clones, plans and job logs are kept on each replica's volume by default, and applies are routed to the replica that made the plan. To make plans and completed job logs available to every replica, and keep them if a replica is lost, enable `--enable-external-stores` with an S3-compatible `plan_store` and `log_store`. If a plan is lost anyway, run `atlantis plan` again: `atlantis apply` refuses to run without a matching plan.

**Q: How to add SSL to Atlantis server?**

A: First, you'll need to get a public/private key pair to serve over SSL.
These need to be in a directory accessible by Atlantis. Then start `atlantis server` with the `--ssl-cert-file` and `--ssl-key-file` flags.
See `atlantis server --help` for more information.

**Q: Can Atlantis detect infrastructure drift?**

A: Yes. When the `--enable-drift-detection` flag is set, Atlantis exposes API endpoints for drift detection, status, and remediation. Drift detection works by running `terraform plan` against the specified branch/ref (outside of a pull request context) and analyzing the plan output for changes. You can trigger drift detection via `POST /api/drift/detect` and retrieve cached results via `GET /api/drift/status`. See [API Endpoints](api-endpoints.md) for details.

**Q: How do I set up scheduled drift detection?**

A: Atlantis provides the drift detection API but does not include a built-in scheduler. You can use an external scheduler (e.g., cron, CI/CD pipelines, or a monitoring tool) to periodically call `POST /api/drift/detect`. Configure [drift webhooks](sending-notifications-via-webhooks.md) to receive Slack or HTTP notifications when drift is detected.

**Q: How can I get Atlantis up and running on AWS?**

A: There is [terraform-aws-atlantis](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-atlantis) project where complete Terraform configurations for running Atlantis on AWS Fargate are hosted. Tested and maintained.
