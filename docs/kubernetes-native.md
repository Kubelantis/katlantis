# Kubernetes-native Atlantis

This fork runs Atlantis as a highly available Deployment. Locks, pull status,
membership and leader election are all stored as Kubernetes objects. It needs
no BoltDB, Redis or persistent volume. The design and its trade-offs are in
[ADR 0003](adr/0003-kubernetes-native-ha.md).

## Install

```bash
kubectl create namespace atlantis
kubectl -n atlantis create secret generic atlantis-vcs \
  --from-literal=ATLANTIS_GH_USER=my-bot \
  --from-literal=ATLANTIS_GH_TOKEN=... \
  --from-literal=ATLANTIS_GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
helm install atlantis deploy/helm/atlantis -n atlantis \
  --set vcsSecretName=atlantis-vcs \
  --set atlantisUrl=https://atlantis.example.com \
  --set repoAllowlist='github.com/example-org/*'
```

Atlantis runs as a StatefulSet: each replica has a stable name and its own
volume for clones and plans (`persistence.*`). The chart installs the
`PullStatus` CRD. It also installs a namespaced Role
limited to Leases and PullStatuses, a cluster token Secret, a
PodDisruptionBudget, and a NetworkPolicy that limits the cluster port to
Atlantis pods. Replicas are spread across nodes and zones. Optional pieces are
an Ingress, an HPA, a ServiceMonitor, a PrometheusRule and OTLP tracing.

Without Helm, the server flags are:

```bash
atlantis server \
  --locking-db-type=kubernetes \
  --cluster-token=$ATLANTIS_CLUSTER_TOKEN   # plus POD_NAME, POD_NAMESPACE, POD_IP from the downward API
```

## How it works

| Concern | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Project locks, global apply lock | `Lease` objects named `lock-*` / `cmdlock-*`. Creating one acquires the lock atomically. |
| Plan/apply status per pull | `PullStatus` objects (`kubectl get pullstatuses`), updated with optimistic concurrency. |
| Which replica handles a pull | Member Leases (`member-*`) plus rendezvous hashing. Webhooks are forwarded to the owner over `--cluster-port`. |
| Two replicas on one pull | Per-pull Lease (`pulllock-*`), re-entrant within a replica and renewed while commands run. A replica stops trusting it after half the lease duration without a renewal, before anyone else may take it over; it then cancels the pull's queued work and refuses to start further steps. |
| Where applies run | On the replica that made the plan (`PullStatus.spec.plannedBy`), because the plan files are on its volume. If that replica is restarting, the apply waits up to `--cluster-plan-holder-wait-seconds` (default 180) for it to return. Skipped when an external plan store is configured. |
| Lost forwarding replies | Each forward has a request ID; retries reuse it and the owner runs it once. If delivery cannot be confirmed and the owner is alive, the command is not re-run elsewhere and the pull request gets a comment. |
| Readiness | Depends only on local state (starting or draining), never on the shared API server, so an API outage cannot remove every replica from the Service. `atlantis_cluster_api_healthy` reports API reachability. |
| Job pages and websockets | Proxied to whichever replica has the job. |
| Housekeeping | The leader (`atlantis-leader` Lease) deletes Leases left by crashed replicas. |
| Rolling update / scale down | The terminating replica marks itself draining. Its pulls move immediately, `/readyz` fails, and running jobs finish before it exits. |

To inspect the cluster state:

```bash
kubectl -n atlantis get leases -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=atlantis -L atlantis.runatlantis.io/type
kubectl -n atlantis get pullstatuses -o wide
kubectl -n atlantis get lease atlantis-leader -o jsonpath='{.spec.holderIdentity}'
```

Nothing written to the API server contains VCS credentials: clone URLs and
pull request bodies are stripped before storing.

## Plans and job logs

By default each replica keeps its clones, plan files and job logs on its own
volume:

- applies are routed to the replica that made the plan;
- live job output is proxied to the replica running the job;
- when a pull request closes, every replica deletes its copies. A replica
  that was down at the time removes them later: its janitor deletes the local
  files of pulls that no longer have a `PullStatus` and were untouched for 24
  hours.

To make plans and completed job logs available to every replica, and keep
them if a replica or its volume is lost, store them in object storage (S3 or
any S3-compatible service):

```yaml
# server-side repo config (chart: externalStores.planStore / .logStore)
external_stores:
  plan_store:
    type: s3
    s3:
      bucket: my-atlantis
      region: eu-west-1
      prefix: atlantis/plans
      server_side_encryption: aws:kms   # AES256, aws:kms or aws:kms:dsse
      kms_key_id: alias/atlantis        # optional, for aws:kms*
  log_store:
    type: s3
    s3:
      bucket: my-atlantis
      region: eu-west-1
      prefix: atlantis/job-logs
      server_side_encryption: AES256
```

together with `--enable-external-stores`. Then:

- applies run on the pull's owner and download the plan, and are refused if
  the plan was made at another commit;
- completed job logs are uploaded when the job finishes and can be opened
  through any replica; running jobs still stream from the replica running
  them;
- both are deleted when the pull request closes.

Plan files and job output can contain secrets: keep server-side encryption
on, restrict the bucket to Atlantis's workload identity (for example IRSA via
`serviceAccount.annotations`), and add a lifecycle rule to expire objects of
pull requests that were never closed.

## Monitoring

To expose metrics, keep the `metrics.prometheus` block in the chart's
`repoConfig`, then enable `metrics.serviceMonitor`. The metrics are:

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `atlantis_cluster_members` | Live replicas seen by this replica |
| `atlantis_cluster_leader` | 1 on the leader |
| `atlantis_cluster_routing_forward_success` / `_forward_error` / `_forward_ambiguous` / `_local` | Command routing outcomes |
| `atlantis_cluster_routing_plan_holder_wait` / `_plan_holder_timeout` | Applies that waited for a restarting plan holder, and waits that gave up |
| `atlantis_cluster_api_healthy` | 1 when the last membership sync with the API server succeeded |
| `atlantis_cluster_pull_lock_lost` | Pull locks this replica lost to another replica |
| `atlantis_plan_risk_assessed{tier}` / `atlantis_plan_risk_error` | Plan risk results |
| `atlantis_cmd_*`, `atlantis_api_*` | Existing Atlantis command metrics |

`metrics.prometheusRule.enabled=true` adds alerts for:

- no leader,
- degraded membership,
- forwarding errors,
- plan risk errors.

## Logging and tracing

Logs are JSON. Command logs include `repo`, `pull`, `replica`, `trace_id` and
`span_id`, so a log line can be followed to its trace.

With `--tracing-enabled` (chart: `tracing.enabled`, `tracing.endpoint`),
Atlantis exports OTLP/gRPC spans. A command produces this span tree:

```
POST /events                          (webhook, on the receiving replica)
└─ atlantis.cluster.forward           (if another replica owns the pull)
   └─ atlantis.internal               (on the owner)
      └─ atlantis.command.plan
         └─ atlantis.project.plan     (repo, pull, project, workspace, dir)
            ├─ atlantis.step.init
            ├─ atlantis.step.plan
            └─ atlantis.plan_risk
```

The exporter and sampler are configured with the standard `OTEL_*`
environment variables.

## Plan risk (TypeSafe Jev)

See [plan-risk.md](plan-risk.md).

## Limitations

- **Plans live on the replica that made them.** Restarts and rolling updates
  keep them (StatefulSet volume, applies wait for the replica). Losing the
  volume or scaling the replica away means re-planning, unless the S3 plan
  store (`external_stores`) is configured.
- **Fencing is best effort for a running terraform process.** A replica that
  loses its pull lock stops starting steps, but a `terraform apply` already
  running continues; the state backend's locking protects that window.
- **Stale clones.** A replica that loses ownership keeps its clones until it
  restarts. They live on `emptyDir`, bounded by `dataVolume.sizeLimit`.
- **Per-replica data.**
  - Drift detection results.
  - The index page's list of running jobs. Locks on the index page are
    cluster-wide.
- **Object size.** A `PullStatus` object is limited by the API server's object
  size (about 1.5 MiB), which is thousands of projects per pull.

## Roadmap

- **M5: remove BoltDB and Redis.** They are kept for now so the fork can merge
  from upstream and so single-replica users can migrate. The removal is:
  1. Make `kubernetes` the default `--locking-db-type`.
  2. Add a one-shot `atlantis migrate-db --from=boltdb|redis` that copies
     locks and pull status into Leases/PullStatuses.
  3. Delete `server/core/boltdb`, `server/core/redis`, their flags, docs and
     `docker-compose` service, and the `go.etcd.io/bbolt`, `go-redis` and
     `miniredis` dependencies.
  4. Port the e2e tests from BoltDB to a fake-client KubeDB. The conformance
     suite already guarantees identical behaviour.
- Store drift results as a CRD and aggregate the job list across replicas.
